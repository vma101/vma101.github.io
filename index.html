                        In my music, design and writing, I aim to package totalities without tediousness, to immortalize that which is important but often overlooked.
                        My training in economics and psychology have instilled a near-obsessive need to understand the strategic value and the full implications 
                        of the content I generate. Thus, my forte is poignancy - wrapping power in subtlety, artful references into discreet canvases, making your audience 
                        think/look/read/listen twice, like a chocolate ganache with an exigent hint of orange zest.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-5"> The world and increasingly, data, is pickle juice - a myriad of flavors and grains, not all of them appealing, battling to engrave 
                        themselves onto just a shred of cucumber flesh. Give me your pickle juice, and let us share the delicious emerging pickle.

                    <!-- <p> I have always liked cooking and the kitchen, and my earliest memory from childhood is that of my mother reprimanding me for entering the kitchen by slapping my feet.
                        "You'd get burned by all the hot pots and pans," she chided, as if to say that since she could not possibly prevent every adversarial circumstance in the world from 
                        coming my way, she might as well control with frenzy those that she could see. My family and the culture I was brought up in has always valued that which is unspoken,
                        our speech a thin veil for emotions too complex for even the most careful turn of phrase. But, I understood, and was a diligent apprentice. Now, I am hard-pressed to 
                        remember a time when I didn't know how to crack an egg, make banana bread, and seal dumplings. Many more outlandish things in life have burned me, but the kitchen has 
                        always been my safe haven, its smells and methodical clanging of wood against metal reminding me of home and the feeling of control.
                    </p>
                    <p> During Covid-19, I found myself stranded in Chicago as an international student doing online classes, with a pantry that was haphazardly stocked by the 
                        supplies of friends who had hastily left for home as schooling turned remote. Instead of calling my parents every three months, I called them every day; 
                        instead of scrolling facebook for events with free food I could subsist off of, I found myself scrolling recipes and dreaming up meals that would incorporate 
                        ingredients I never had the disposable income to buy - shirataki noodles, goat cheese, whole slabs of meat (not minced!), cured sausage, boullion, berries, 
                        baker's chocolate, butter... I began cooking outlandish meals for myself and a few close friends, and we would fawn over pictures of buns and cakes my mom had fashioned
                        with her newfound free time now that she was working from home. The idea of a shared instagram account was floated in our family phone calls and my friends'
                        responses to my contactless food deliveries, and here it is.
